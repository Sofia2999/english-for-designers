# Year in review

**In a nutshell**

The first thought that come to my head are very negative, not many good things happened lately. It’s hard to make this positive, I feel like there is nothing positive to say. But I also don’t want to make this too negative, and cry about small things that make me want to crawl into a hole.
	My dad puts a lot of pressure on me, I don’t think he even realises, he asked me to “plan my future”, but how can I plan something that I don’t see. I have no idea what I want to do, who I want to be. I am scared of making a wrong choice, I’m scared of missing out on life, on myself, on opportunities (that don’t exist). I look at all those people that have known since they were little, that have their life figured out. I spend most of my days unsuccessfully trying to find myself. On the other hand, I don’t get to complain, cause "everything is fine". There is a million of videos on the internet that say, "it's okey to be lost, it's okey to not know what you want to be, or what you want to do." and although it cool and all, i don't really want to be in this situation, i don't want to waste my time, i want to have my things figured out. And that's probably the thing that bothers me the most : i dont want to waste time. I'm terrified of wasting time. And i feel like i've been wasting time for my whole life.

I didn't do any projects, i didn't get any opportunities. I did an internship, could not be more disappointed from the experience. 
Everyone says that it's okey! But why do i feel like it's not! I doesen't feel okey, it bothers me. 

**What i learned?**  

I did learned a lot of things. I got to know Me a little more. Sometimes all this complaining seems stuppid. Nobody cares! But it would be lying if i said this year was amazing and full of memories. No. It sucked. But life goes on. There is a song, and the lyrics go 
"a 100 bad days made a 100 good stories, 100 good storie make me intresting at parties". And i don't party, but i do love this sentence. 
I got back to photography and found passion for videography. I try to update my portfolio to maybe do videography/cinematography professionaly.
