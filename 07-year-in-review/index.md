# Year in review

The first thought that come to my head are very negative, not many good things happened lately. It’s hard to make this positive, I feel like there is nothing positive to say. But I also don’t want to make this negative, and cry about small things that make me want to crawl into a hole.
	My dad puts a lot of pressure on me, I don’t think he even realises, he asked me to “plan my future”, but how can I plan something that I don’t see. I have no idea what I want to do, who I want to be. I am scared of making a wrong choice, I’m scared of missing out on life, on myself, on opportunities (that don’t exist). I look at all those people that have known since they were little. I spend most of my days unsuccessfully trying to find myself. On the other hand, I don’t get to complain, cause everything is fine. There is a million of videos on the internet that say, "it's okey to be lost, it's okey to not know what you want to be, or what you want to do." and although it cool and all, but i don't really want to be in this situation, i don't want to waste my time. And that's probably the thing that bothers me the most : i dont want to waste time. I'm terrified of wasting time. And i feel like i've been wasting time for mt whole life.

 All that aside... let's add a few possitive words into this essey. 

I did learned a lot of things. I did find peace (to some extent). I got to know Me a little more. So what did i learn? And how?
It's not all about "learning", but also about finding a way, acceptind and changing.
