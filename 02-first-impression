Hi, i'm Sofia.
It's hard to discribe who i am at the moment as i am so many things, but i'm going to tell you what i aspire to be. I aspire to be a 3D artist, an illustrator,an athlete and one day to become a dietitian. 


What i'm passonate about?

Well... i love animals, they play a huge part in my life. I grew up with an animal loving mom and a lot of animals. Me and my mom are the "vegans" of our family. We often try to help animal shelters and animals in need. 
...
I love to draw, especially digitaly. My passion begun with my Ipad Air 2 that i so deperatly wantend to draw on. It's an old ipad so the apple pens aren't compatible. So i DIY'd my own drawing pen, and scratched the hell out of its screen.

I love phorography, but as my priorities are elsewhere i don't have the time anymore. 

I LOVE sports, i love it to the moon and back. It's what keeps me sane. I do spend a lot time in the gym but I'm a distance runner most days, but i recenly returned to the track, joined a team and do 400-800 sprints. 
Why? Because there is no better feeling than to do what you love with people that get you. Shoutout to my teammate. 

I'm intrested in anything that has to do with sports! Nutrition, kinesology, and much more. I also love herbology!
