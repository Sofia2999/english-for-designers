**Discipline**

Discipline can sound as something negative... but to me it's a positive, important word. especially self discipline, it’s the most important thing in life. It's one of the hardest things to have, to keep. Discipline is usually used negatively, as "this child had no discipline", but i wouldn't call a kid ... not disciplined, more like ill mannered, become at that age we aren’t as self conscious as adults, their perception of the world and themselves is way different, they relay on their parents to give them instructions. Most people lack discipline. me personally am not as disciplined as I would like to be, but I also am well aware of that. I hate when people react surprised when I tell them I do a lot of sports, What I describe as my usual lunch, they call “healthy”. People have become undisciplined. Discipline is something that is thought but at the same time it's something you have to practice yourself, you have to discipline yourself. It doesn't mean to be a soldier and to get screamed at by a moron with a "better " badge than you... what i mean is to take care of yourself. Having discipline to go out once in a while, to keep doing what you started, do the things you said you would. 
The importance of self-discipline is major. It builds you, it makes you go futher  in life.
