google describes "Running" as the action or movement of propelling yourself forward rapidly on foot
OR The rapid movement of one's feet at a pace that exceeds normal walking speed.

Let's simplify 

It's a sport, right? 

people do it to loose weight, to get fitter... blah blah

and don't get me wrong, so did i. 

BUT i see it differently now. 


I the kind of person that has a new hobby every week. I did karate, dance, pottery, photography... i played the guitar, well i tried. 
Anyways. The one thing i did for more than a half of my life is .... no not running... it's horse riding. Unfortunately life happened and i had to find something else. But don't worry, i do spend a lot of time with horses... muching put my horses stable and that fun stuff. haha 

anyways... i had to find something else, gym is boring so i tried distance running. Trained and did a few 10k races, questioned my life decisions on the 6th km ... than signed up for another one right after the race i finished the race.

My friend than invited me to join a track team, and i thought SURE what could go wrong, right? Right?.....

When i say i my legs hurt like never in my life, i mean it. But i loved every damn second of it. 

The I HAVE TO go running because "Yay i have to go run on the track with my teammates today! "

But it's not all fun and games, let's be honest, there are days i don't feel like ... running, living... 
Those are the days you just get up, and get it over with, and believe it or not, you will feel better if you do. 
And there is no motivation that will get you up.. it's discipline, sorry to disappoint. So search for discipline, not motivation. And itâ€™s also completely fine to take a break, but you havr to be certain that you actually need it. 

And that works in every situation... in life. Motivation is temporary, discipline is the way to go. 

But what if you can't run? 
you walk. 

Literally and figuratively. 

I recently found out i have a medical problem/ condition that causes me quite a lot of pain and i really shouldn't be running. 
So i walk... figuratively... i take my pain more seriously, i am more careful and keep going as long as i can. Will i be able to continue for long? No ... did i had a breakdown? yes.
But life goes on... and you never know where it will take me... and i'm okey with that (not like a have a choice) 

but hey... someone once said, if one door closes, find another one. 

everything is going to be fine. 

i hope... haha
