# My voice, tone and style
## Voice



  i consider myself **Friendly** but i feel like sometiomes i can seem mean, or unfriendly at first, to those who don't know me. I don't like to pretend to be happy if i don't feel happy or smile for no reason. I got told to smile my whole life. "Why so frowny? Smile!"... I wasn't unhappy or anyting, it's just how i look i guess. I'm **Straightforward**, if something bothers me i'll let the person know. I guess it might startle or suprise some people at first, but most of my friends are those who appretiete my honesty. And i prefer honest people over those that pretend to be someone else. My voice is **Monotone**, sometimes people think that i'm bored of the conversatio were having, but in reality, that's just my voice. I always try to be as nice as posible, even if the 


## Tone

  **Polite** - I always try to be as nice as posible, even if the person is a .... well you know, a pain in the behind. 
  **Emotional** - And no, i don't mean my tone is histerical, but i am quite sensitive, so sometiomes it just blows up. I can't really help it. If my brain gets overwhealmed, i cry. Sorry for that... And some people get really offended by it... i had a teacher scream at me for "emotionally blackmailing her"... a fun expirience for sure. 
  **Serious** - Don't get me wrong, i'm not too serious, but i try to avoid talking about things i know nothing about, i mean i avoid spreading missinformation and i take it seriously when someone asks me for help or advice.

  I sometimes feel like i'm different, not like "oh i'm so special, i'm so different", but more like... i don't get most people, and they don't get me. I'm "strange".  I always was the wierd kid, the shy kid that ended up alone, the one no one wanted to be in group with. And i don't mean it in a bad way necessary, it's just a fact. 
  I am a nice person, i can be a happy, funny, lighthearted person, but i guess i show it differently. I don't really know. I really apreciete my friends, espetially my teammate, she gets me, even my weird self. :)
  
## Style

  It really depends on who i'm talking to. 
 If i'm talking to a person i don't know i will always be as polite and respectful as i can. 
 When i talk to my friends i use a lot of **emojis** and sometimes **memes**. I like to make jokes. Same with my family. I created a family chat like years ago, and it's the best thing ever. We send each other photos, memes, jokes, update my brother on things ( as he lives in England ) and chat about everything. 
 I never write anything i wouldn't say in reall life. I hate when people say things online that they wouldn't say to a persones face... it's just stupid.

 Well... that's it, i overshared enough for today i think, thank you for reading. Byeeeee
